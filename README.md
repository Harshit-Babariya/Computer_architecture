This project was a part of my Computer architecture Labrotary course at IIT DHARWAD
In lab_1 we wrote some basic programs in assembly language
Then we made an assembler  for toyRisc ISA which converted an asm file to .out file
Then I simulated a single cycle processor followed by a 5 stage pipeline processor which used interlocks to resolve hazards
Then to simulate latency I did discrete event simulation followed by implementing caches to reduce the latency
